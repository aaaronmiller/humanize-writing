# Humanize Writing Skill

Transform generic, formulaic prose into authentic, engaging writing through systematic improvement of vocabulary precision, structural variety, and stylistic distinctiveness.

## Purpose & Scope

This skill improves writing quality by addressing patterns that make prose feel generic, flat, or impersonal—whether those patterns originate from AI assistance, committee authorship, template-based writing, or underdeveloped craft.

**Primary Goal:** Produce better, more authentic writing  
**Secondary Effect:** Writing improved by these techniques naturally resists AI detection

**This skill is NOT designed for:**
- Misrepresenting authorship
- Academic dishonesty
- Violating disclosure requirements
- Deceiving readers about content origin

## Quick Start

1. Analyze input text for quality issues (vocabulary, structure, rhythm)
2. Apply targeted improvements across three dimensions: lexical, structural, stylistic
3. Validate output authenticity
4. Iterate based on validation feedback

## Ethical Framework

### Legitimate Uses

- **Polishing AI-assisted drafts:** Improving content you've created with AI collaboration
- **Developing your voice:** Using techniques to strengthen your personal writing style
- **Improving clarity:** Making committee-written or template-based content more engaging
- **Learning craft:** Understanding what makes writing feel authentic to improve skills
- **Professional editing:** Improving client work within agreed terms

### Illegitimate Uses

- **Academic fraud:** Submitting AI-written work as solely your own where prohibited
- **Professional misrepresentation:** Violating contractual or employer AI-use policies
- **Deceptive attribution:** Claiming sole authorship where disclosure is expected
- **Bypassing vetting:** Circumventing legitimate content review processes

### Context-Specific Guidance

| Context | Recommended Approach |
|---------|---------------------|
| Academic | Disclose AI use per institution policy; focus on learning, not evasion |
| Professional | Follow employer AI policies; when uncertain, ask |
| Commercial | Check client expectations; many accept AI-assisted content |
| Personal | Full freedom; improve your writing however you choose |
| Journalism | Verify facts independently; follow publication AI policies |

### When in Doubt

**Default to disclosure.** Many contexts now accept AI-assisted writing when disclosed. Concealment carries greater risk than transparency.

## Limitations Acknowledgment

**What this skill can achieve:**
- Measurably improve writing variety and engagement
- Reduce formulaic, generic patterns
- Develop more distinctive voice
- Make prose read more naturally

**What this skill cannot guarantee:**
- Complete evasion of AI detection (no technique can)
- That improved writing won't still be flagged by detectors
- That detectors won't evolve to identify new patterns
- That all "AI tells" are actually AI-exclusive

> **Important:** Research shows AI detectors have 10-20% false positive rates, higher for non-native English speakers and formal academic writing. Legitimate formal prose (clear structure, proper grammar, explicit transitions) can trigger false positives. This skill improves quality, not detection evasion.

## Quantitative Thresholds

Use these thresholds when assessing text:

| Metric | Acceptable | Warning | Revise |
|--------|------------|---------|--------|
| Transitional phrases per 1000 words | 0-3 | 4-6 | 7+ |
| Corporate buzzwords per 1000 words | 0-2 | 3-5 | 6+ |
| Trailing participial phrases per page | 0-2 | 3-4 | 5+ |
| Semicolons per page | 0-2 | 3-4 | 5+ |
| Paragraph length variance (SD) | >30 | 15-30 | <15 |
| Sentence length range (max-min) | >25 words | 15-25 | <15 |

## Priority Ordering

Address issues in this order (highest impact first):

1. **Vocabulary blacklist** - Remove flagged words/phrases (10 min)
2. **Trailing participial phrases** - Fix ", creating/demonstrating/suggesting" patterns (5 min)
3. **Sentence length variance** - Add short punchy sentences, vary rhythm (10 min)
4. **Voice markers** - Add rhetorical questions, contractions, personality (10 min)
5. **Paragraph variance** - Merge/split for length variation (5 min)
6. **Fine polish** - Read aloud, minor adjustments (5 min)

## Core Framework: Three Dimensions of Writing Quality

### Dimension 1: Lexical Precision (Word Choice)

Generic, formulaic writing overuses certain vocabulary. See `references/ai-vocabulary-list.md` for the comprehensive list.

**Common weakness markers:**
- Transitional padding: furthermore, moreover, additionally, consequently, nevertheless
- Corporate buzzwords: leverage, optimize, streamline, robust, scalable, synergy
- Hedging language: it's worth noting, it's important to consider, arguably
- Grandiose descriptors: groundbreaking, revolutionary, transformative, pivotal, paramount
- Journey metaphors: embark, navigate, delve, explore, uncover

**Transformation approach:**
- Replace with simpler, concrete alternatives
- Remove unnecessary qualifiers entirely
- Use specific nouns over abstract ones
- Prefer common verbs over latinate alternatives

### Dimension 2: Structural Variety (Organization)

Formulaic writing follows predictable, rigid structures.

**Common structural weaknesses:**
- Uniform paragraph length (all ~100 words)
- Rigid topic-sentence-support-conclusion format per paragraph
- Lists/bullets appearing mid-essay
- Long, summarizing conclusions starting with "In conclusion/Overall/In summary"
- Excessive parallel construction
- "From X to Y" prepositional patterns
- Present-participial trailing phrases: "X verb Y, creating Z"

**Transformation approach:**
- Vary paragraph length dramatically (some 2 sentences, some 8)
- Bury topic sentences occasionally
- Let some paragraphs end without conclusion
- Merge related short paragraphs
- Break long paragraphs at unexpected points

### Dimension 3: Stylistic Distinctiveness (Rhythm & Voice)

Generic writing lacks natural prosodic variation and personal voice.

**Common stylistic weaknesses:**
- Uniform sentence length (medium sentences only)
- Semicolon-heavy compound sentences
- Missing sentence fragments
- Absence of rhetorical questions
- Overly balanced/hedged arguments
- Generic, neutral tone throughout
- Missing contractions in casual contexts
- Perfect grammar everywhere

**Transformation approach:**
- Vary sentence length intentionally (short. Long flowing ones that build momentum. Medium.)
- Add occasional fragments for emphasis
- Include rhetorical questions where natural
- Use contractions in appropriate contexts
- Allow deliberate minor imperfections
- Insert genuine opinion/perspective

## Quality Improvement Process

### Step 1: Diagnostic Analysis

Scan input text and identify:
1. Word-level quality issues (overused vocabulary, imprecise terms)
2. Structural uniformity score (paragraph length variance)
3. Sentence rhythm analysis (length distribution)
4. Voice presence (personality markers, opinion, specificity)

### Step 2: Vocabulary Transformation

For each flagged word/phrase:
1. Assess if removal preserves meaning (often: just delete)
2. If needed, substitute with concrete alternative
3. Prefer Anglo-Saxon over Latinate vocabulary
4. Replace abstractions with specifics

**Example transformations:**
- "leverage" → "use"
- "utilize" → "use"
- "facilitate" → "help" or "enable"
- "it's worth noting that" → [delete]
- "in the realm of" → "in"
- "a multitude of" → "many" or "several"
- "groundbreaking" → describe specifically what changed
- "navigate the complexities" → "work through" or "handle"

### Step 3: Structural Restructuring

1. Map existing paragraph lengths
2. Identify uniform sections
3. Apply variance:
   - Split one long paragraph into 2-3 shorter ones
   - Merge 2-3 related short paragraphs
   - Relocate topic sentences
4. Remove or shorten summarizing conclusions
5. Eliminate unnecessary transitional phrases between paragraphs

### Step 4: Rhythm & Voice Injection

1. Find 3 consecutive medium-length sentences → replace middle with short or long
2. Identify passive constructions → activate where natural
3. Locate hedging clusters → commit to positions where appropriate
4. Add contractions in conversational sections
5. Insert occasional colloquialisms appropriate to context
6. Consider adding parenthetical asides, em-dashes, or unconventional punctuation

### Step 5: Authenticity Check

Before finalizing, verify:
- Does it sound like a specific person, not a committee?
- Are there moments of genuine opinion or personality?
- Does the rhythm feel varied when read aloud?
- Would the reader believe a human wrote this quickly, imperfectly?

## Cultural & Linguistic Considerations

### Important Caveat

Many patterns identified as "AI tells" also appear in:
- **Non-native English writing:** Formal constructions, predictable transitions, limited colloquialisms
- **Academic training:** Writers taught formal structures may naturally produce "AI-like" patterns
- **Cultural rhetorical traditions:** Some cultures prefer explicit transitions, balanced arguments, formal register
- **Technical writing conventions:** Fields like legal, medical, scientific writing have specific norms

### Avoid False Assumptions

Before "correcting" writing:
1. Consider the writer's background and training
2. Recognize that "natural" varies by culture and context
3. Don't assume formal = artificial
4. Understand that detection tools have higher false positive rates for diverse writers

### Adaptation Guidance

- For non-native writers: Focus on vocabulary precision and rhythm; preserve cultural voice
- For technical contexts: Maintain necessary formality while varying structure
- For global audiences: Balance accessibility with cultural authenticity

## Content-Type Specific Guidelines

### Time Investment Estimates

| Task | Quick Pass | Thorough Edit | Full Voice Development |
|------|------------|---------------|------------------------|
| 500 words | 10-15 min | 30-45 min | 1-2 hours |
| 1000 words | 20-30 min | 60-90 min | 2-4 hours |
| 2500 words | 45-60 min | 2-3 hours | Half day |

*Note: Full voice development is an ongoing process requiring multiple drafts and feedback cycles.*

### Technical/Professional Writing
- Maintain precision while varying rhythm
- Replace buzzwords with specific technical terms
- Allow some conversational tone in explanations
- Keep contractions minimal but not absent
- Preserve necessary formality for credibility
- **Time factor:** Often requires less rhythm work; focus on vocabulary

### Creative/Narrative Writing
- Maximize sentence length variation
- Embrace fragments and non-standard punctuation
- Inject distinctive voice markers
- Allow rule-breaking for effect
- Develop character-specific voices in dialogue
- **Time factor:** Voice development takes longest here

### Academic Writing

**Important:** Academic writing has legitimate formal conventions that may trigger AI detectors. Don't "humanize" these:

**Legitimate academic patterns (KEEP):**
- "We present/propose/demonstrate" - standard research paper language
- "This paper introduces/addresses" - appropriate self-reference
- Formal transitions between major sections
- Explicit structure (numbered sections, clear headings)
- Evidence-based hedging ("results suggest", "data indicates")
- Citation-heavy prose

**Patterns to improve:**
- Corporate buzzwords (leverage, utilize, synergy) - replace with precise terms
- Empty hedging ("it's worth noting") - delete or replace with evidence
- Trailing participials - restructure into separate sentences
- Uniform paragraph/sentence length - add variance

**Academic-specific guidance:**
- Preserve formal register while varying rhythm
- Replace generic hedging with evidence-based qualifiers
- Maintain structure but vary paragraph length
- Add rhetorical questions in Discussion sections (appropriate for engagement)
- Use contractions sparingly in informal subsections only
- Follow discipline-specific citation conventions
- **Time factor:** 45-90 min per 2500 words; check institution AI policies

### Marketing/Persuasive Writing
- Replace grandiose claims with concrete benefits
- Use direct, active voice
- Vary sentence length for impact
- Add personality without losing credibility
- Test with target audience when possible
- **Time factor:** Often tight deadlines; focus on highest-impact changes

### Journalism/Reporting
- Prioritize clarity and accuracy over style
- Verify all facts independently regardless of source
- Follow publication AI-use policies
- Maintain objectivity while improving readability
- **Time factor:** Breaking news = minimal; features allow more polish

## Measuring Effectiveness

### Quality Metrics (Recommended)

1. **Reader perception survey**
   - Does it feel authentic?
   - Is the voice distinctive?
   - Does it engage you?
   - Would you guess this is AI-assisted?

2. **Structural analysis**
   - Paragraph length variance (SD > 30 words = good)
   - Sentence length range (> 25 words range = good)
   - Vocabulary diversity (unique/total > 40%)

3. **Editorial review**
   - Does voice remain consistent?
   - Are improvements natural?
   - Is meaning preserved?

### Detection Tool Scores (Use with Caution)

- AI detection tools can provide feedback but have limitations
- False positive rates: 10-20% (higher for non-native English)
- Accuracy varies by detector and model used for generation
- Do not optimize solely for detection scores
- Quality improvement matters more than evasion

### Success Indicators

- Reading aloud sounds natural
- Specific details replace abstractions
- Personality emerges without forcing
- Structure varies meaningfully
- Word choices feel precise

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Do NOT:**
- Simply run text through a paraphraser (creates new generic patterns)
- Replace all flagged words mechanically (sounds unnatural)
- Make all sentences short (overcorrection)
- Add random errors for "authenticity" (obviously fake)
- Strip all structure (becomes incoherent)
- Optimize solely for detection evasion (wrong goal)
- Ignore context and audience needs
- Remove all formality from technical writing
- Sacrifice clarity for "voice"

**DO:**
- Make targeted, thoughtful substitutions
- Preserve the writer's intended meaning
- Inject personality appropriate to context
- Vary interventions naturally
- Read output aloud for rhythm check
- Disclose AI assistance when appropriate
- Consider reader expectations
- Maintain genre-appropriate conventions
- Balance authenticity with clarity
