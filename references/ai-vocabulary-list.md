## Usage Notes

1. **Context matters**: Some words are appropriate in specific contexts (e.g., "stakeholders" in corporate writing)
2. **Don't over-substitute**: Sometimes deleting is better than replacing
3. **Check frequency**: One "furthermore" is fine; three per page is a tell
4. **Preserve meaning**: Ensure substitution doesn't change intended meaning
5. **Read aloud**: Best test for natural flow after substitutions

## Frequency Thresholds

| Category | Per 1000 words | Per page (~300 words) |
|----------|----------------|----------------------|
| Transitional phrases | 0-3 acceptable | 0-1 acceptable |
| Corporate jargon | 0-2 acceptable | 0-1 acceptable |
| Hedging language | 0-2 acceptable | 0-1 acceptable |
| Grandiose descriptors | 0-1 acceptable | 0 preferred |
| Journey metaphors | 0-1 acceptable | 0 preferred |

## Context Exemptions

**Technical/CS writing** - These are legitimate when used precisely:
- "framework" - if describing actual software framework
- "architecture" - if describing system design
- "optimize" - if describing algorithmic optimization
- "scalable" - if describing technical property
- "ecosystem" - if describing development ecosystem

**Academic writing** - These are standard conventions:
- "We present/propose" - standard first-person plural
- "This paper/study" - appropriate self-reference
- "Results suggest/indicate" - evidence-based hedging
- "Furthermore" - acceptable once per major section transition

**Quotes and dialogue** - Exempt from all rules when quoting sources or writing dialogue.

## Detection Evolution Note

> **2024-2025 Update:** The word "delve" was heavily flagged by detectors in 2023 but usage has decreased. Detectors now focus on combinations of patterns rather than single words. A single flagged word rarely triggers detection; clusters of 5+ patterns per page raise flags.
