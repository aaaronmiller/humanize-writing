# Content-Type Specific Humanization Guides

## Blog Posts

### Target Metrics
- Active voice: 65-75%
- Sentence variety: High (mix all lengths)
- Personal pronouns: Encouraged (I, we, you)
- Contractions: 3-7 per 1000 words
- Hedging language: <3%
- Readability level: 7th-9th grade

### Humanization Priorities

**1. Open with specific observation**

**AI version:**
> "Remote work has become increasingly prevalent in the modern business landscape, with many companies recognizing its potential benefits."

**Human version:**
> "I haven't been to an office in three years. Neither have most of my colleagues. And honestly? We're more productive than ever."

**Rule:** Personal + specific + confidence. No hedging.

**2. Use "I/we discovered" instead of "research shows"**

**AI version:**
> "Research indicates that remote workers experience higher levels of job satisfaction."

**Human version:**
> "When we surveyed remote workers, they reported surprising levels of satisfaction. Here's why:"

**Effect:** You become the guide, not a reporter of facts.

**3. Concrete examples before abstractions**

**AI version:**
> "Remote work enables enhanced productivity through improved focus and reduced environmental distractions."

**Human version:**
> "Sarah got promoted because she finished her project three weeks early. The reason? At home, she's not interrupted by the 47 Slack conversations happening at office. She can actually think."

**Rule:** Story/example first (2-3 sentences). Then the principle (1 sentence).

**4. Direct reader engagement**

**AI version:**
> "The implications for organizational structure warrant further consideration."

**Human version:**
> "Here's what this means for your team: Your org chart's probably wrong."

**Technique:** "Here's what this means for..." + specific consequence

**5. Ending signals honesty, not conclusions**

**AI version:**
> "In conclusion, remote work represents a significant opportunity for organizations seeking to optimize employee satisfaction and operational efficiency."

**Human version:**
> "Will remote work last? Probably. But not because it's perfect. Because once you experience working from home, going back feels insane."

**Technique:** End with honest observation, not summary.

### Common Blog Post Patterns to Avoid

| Pattern | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---------|------------|-----|
| "The [Adjective] Guide to [X]" | Generic, overdone | "What I Learned About [X]" or "[X]: The Honest Version" |
| "Here are [N] ways to..." | Listicle feel | Weave into narrative, not bullets |
| "Let's talk about..." | Cliché opener | Jump straight in |
| Rhetorical questions | Questions | Direct statement |
| "Interestingly..." | Fake enthusiasm | Show why it's interesting through detail |

## Academic/Technical Writing

### Target Metrics
- Active voice: 75-85%
- Sentence variety: Controlled (medium-long predominant)
- Personal pronouns: Formal (first person collective: "we," "our"; limited "I")
- Contractions: None (unless specific regional voice)
- Hedging language: <2%
- Tone: Expert without pretension

### Humanization Priorities

**1. Use "we" and "our" appropriately**

**Stiff version:**
> "It was determined by the research team that the hypothesis was incorrect."

**Human version:**
> "We were wrong. Our initial hypothesis didn't hold."

**Where it applies:** Research papers, technical documentation, collaborative fields

**Not where it applies:** First-person reflections (use "I"), purely expository writing

**2. Commit to statements; avoid hedging**

**Hedged version:**
> "It could be argued that the results seem to suggest that optimization may be possible."

**Committed version:**
> "The results indicate optimization is possible."

**Strong version:** 
> "We can optimize this system."

**Rule:** If you're not sure enough to commit, acknowledge uncertainty directly: "We don't yet know whether..." or "The evidence is mixed, but..."

**3. Replace "one must acknowledge" with direct voice**

**Formal hedging:**
> "One must acknowledge that previous research suggested..."

**Direct:**
> "Earlier research showed..."

**Natural:**
> "We've known since Smith's 2015 study that..."

**4. Show your reasoning, not just conclusions**

**Conclusion-only:**
> "These results suggest improved efficiency."

**With reasoning:**
> "These results suggest improved efficiency—response time decreased 40% while error rate remained stable."

**Better:**
> "We saw efficiency gains: response time dropped 40% while we maintained the same error rate. The gain came from, we believe, better indexing strategy."

**Effect:** Reader follows your thinking, not just your conclusion.

**5. Technical terms + clear explanation**

**Bad:** Define in footnote and move on
**Good:** Define inline naturally

**Example:**
> "We used zero-copy protocols—essentially, instead of duplicating data in memory each time we move it, we pass references to the original data. This cut processing overhead by 35%."

**Technique:** Technical term → natural explanation → concrete impact

### Common Academic Patterns to Avoid

| Pattern | Problem | Better |
|---------|---------|--------|
| "It is well-known that..." | Passive + hedging | State what's known and cite it |
| "The data suggests that..." | Weak | "The data shows..." or "We found..." |
| "One could argue..." | Hedging | Just argue it, or "Some argue..." |
| "It appears to be the case..." | Passive + hedging | State it directly |
| "As discussed above..." | Backward reference | Cite specifically or reference by idea |
| Passive voice dominance | Unclear who did what | Make researchers the subject |

## Marketing/Product Copy

### Target Metrics
- Active voice: 85%+
- Sentence variety: High (keep pace quick)
- Personal pronouns: "You" heavily (speak to reader)
- Contractions: 5-10 per 1000 words (natural)
- Hedging language: 0%
- Tone: Enthusiastic but specific, never empty

### Humanization Priorities

**1. Replace clichés with specific benefits**

**Cliché version:**
> "Our innovative platform revolutionizes workflow optimization through cutting-edge artificial intelligence."

**Specific version:**
> "Emails get triaged automatically. Spam never clutters your inbox again. Your team spends 2 fewer hours per day on email—that's 10 hours per week nobody's wasting."

**Rule:** For every claim, a concrete example or metric.

**2. Speak to actual problem, not hype**

**Hype version:**
> "Our next-generation AI solution disrupts the industry with game-changing capabilities."

**Problem-focused version:**
> "You're drowning in data. We help you see patterns in minutes, not months."

**Better version:**
> "Your data scientists spend 70% of time cleaning data. Ours? 15%. They're actually building models."

**3. "You" instead of "our platform"**

**Product-focused:**
> "The platform enables advanced analytics and reporting capabilities."

**You-focused:**
> "You get real-time dashboards. You can see what's working, what's not, and why."

**Why it works:** Readers imagine themselves using it.

**4. Show the transformation**

**Feature list:**
> "Includes automation, integrations, and real-time syncing."

**Transformation:**
> "You set it up Friday. Monday morning, everything's syncing. By Wednesday, you've automated 50% of your manual work."

**5. Credibility through specificity, not superlatives**

**Superlatives (weak):**
> "The most advanced solution. Trusted by industry leaders."

**Specific (strong):**
> "Handles 10M+ transactions per day. Used by 500+ companies including [big names]."

> "Automates 60% of routine tasks (based on 2024 user survey)"

> "Reduces setup time from 4 weeks to 2 days"

### Common Marketing Patterns to Avoid

| Pattern | Problem | Better |
|---------|---------|--------|
| "Revolutionary/Game-changing/Cutting-edge" | Overused, vague | Describe actual change |
| "Industry-leading" | Unsupported claim | Specific metric or user count |
| "Next-generation" | Generic tech speak | What's new compared to what? |
| "Seamless" | Overused, vague | "You don't have to..." or describe actual ease |
| Exclamation points everywhere | Artificial enthusiasm | Use sparingly; let content create energy |
| "Best-in-class" | Claim without evidence | Actual comparison or metric |

## Emails

### Target Metrics
- Active voice: 80%+
- Sentence variety: High (keep scannable)
- Personal pronouns: Natural (I, we, you)
- Contractions: 5-15 per 1000 words (natural speech)
- Hedging language: 0%
- Tone: Conversational, direct, human

### Humanization Priorities

**1. First sentence answers: Why am I reading this?**

**Hedged version:**
> "I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out regarding the project we discussed last week, as there have been some developments that I felt warranted your attention."

**Direct version:**
> "Quick update on the [Project] deadline—we're accelerating it to [Date]."

**Better version:**
> "Bad news on the timeline. Good news on the solution."

**2. Clear ask, not buried**

**Buried ask:**
> "I was thinking that it might be beneficial if we could potentially schedule a meeting to discuss the quarterly objectives and perhaps align on some strategic initiatives moving forward."

**Clear ask:**
> "Can we meet Friday to lock in Q1 goals? 30 minutes?"

**Even better:**
> "I'm blocking 30 min Friday at 3pm. Let's nail down Q1. You in?"

**3. Use contractions**

**Formal (feels inauthentic in email):**
> "I have completed the analysis. It is ready for your review."

**Natural:**
> "I've finished the analysis. It's ready for you."

**Rule:** If you wouldn't say it aloud in a meeting, rewrite it.

**4. Personality, not corporate tone**

**Corporate:**
> "We appreciate your partnership and look forward to continued collaboration on future initiatives."

**Personality:**
> "Thanks for being easy to work with. Let's do this again."

**Specific personality:**
> "This was the smoothest launch I've been part of. Great job."

**5. Short paragraphs, white space**

**Wall of text:**
> "Regarding the implementation strategy and timeline, we've identified three key phases that will require coordination across teams including engineering, product, and sales. The first phase focuses on infrastructure, the second on feature development, and the third on market testing and optimization."

**Scannable:**
> Three phases:
> 1. Infrastructure (engineering focus)
> 2. Features (product focus)
> 3. Testing (sales + product)

**Effect:** Email is readable in 10 seconds.

### Common Email Patterns to Avoid

| Pattern | Problem | Better |
|---------|---------|--------|
| "I hope this email finds you well" | Cliché opening | Jump to content |
| "As mentioned previously" | Vague reference | Reference specifically or delete |
| "At your earliest convenience" | Formal evasion | Actual date/time |
| "Please advise" | Passive corporate speak | "What do you think?" or "Let me know" |
| Forwarding without comment | Lazy | 1 sentence context at top |
| "Touching base" | Corporate cliché | "Quick update" or state the actual reason |
| Signature with 6 lines | Noise | Name, title, one contact method |

## Formal Documents (Legal, Finance, Official)

### When NOT to Over-Humanize

Some content requires formality. Use selective humanization:

**Keep formal:**
- Official language, legal precision
- Consistency across document
- Consistent tone

**Humanize by removing:**
- Unnecessary hedging
- Obvious clichés
- Repetition
- Passive voice where actor matters

**Example:**

**Overly formal:**
> "It is respectfully requested that all personnel be apprised of the aforementioned policy modifications within the specified timeframe to ensure comprehensive organizational alignment."

**Formal but human:**
> "Please share this policy update with your teams by [date]."

**Rule:** Keep formality, remove stuffiness.

| Marketing copy | Low | High | High | Many | Yes |
| Email | Low | High | High | Few focused | Yes |
| Technical docs | Medium-High | Low | Low | Many (code/diagrams) | No |
| Legal document | High | None | None | As required | No |
| Product description | Low | High | High | Several | Yes |
| Internal memo | Medium | Medium | High | As needed | Yes |

## Format-Specific Notes

### Bullets
Humanize by:
- Using active voice in each bullet
- Varying bullet length (not all same length)
- Adding concrete specifics, not generalities

**AI version:**
- Increased productivity
- Enhanced efficiency
- Improved user experience

**Human version:**
- Shipped 30% more features
- Cut load time from 8s to 2s
- Users complete signup 60% faster

### Lists
Same principles. Avoid parallel structure if it sounds robotic. Mix structures.

### Headings
Avoid clichés. Be specific.

**Bad:** "Why This Matters," "Key Takeaways," "The Bottom Line"

**Good:** "What This Breaks," "The Real Bottleneck," "Where You'll Save Time"

### Subheadings
Same rules as main copy. Make them informative, specific.

**Bad:** "Implementation," "Results," "Conclusion"

**Good:** "How We Built It," "We Cut Response Time 40%," "Should You Do This?"
