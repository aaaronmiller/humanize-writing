## Paragraph-Level Patterns

### Pattern 1: Uniform Paragraph Length

**AI tendency:** All paragraphs approximately same length (80-120 words)

**Human variation:**
- Some paragraphs: 1-2 sentences (20-40 words)
- Some paragraphs: 5-8 sentences (150-200 words)
- Occasional single-sentence paragraphs for emphasis

**Fix:** After drafting, intentionally vary paragraph length. Merge related short paragraphs. Split long ones at natural pauses.

### Pattern 2: Rigid Topic-Support-Conclusion

**AI tendency:** Every paragraph follows:
1. Topic sentence
2. Supporting evidence
3. Concluding/transitional sentence

**Human variation:**
- Topic sentence sometimes buried mid-paragraph
- Some paragraphs end without explicit conclusion
- Some paragraphs are purely transitional
- Conclusions appear where needed, not everywhere

**Fix:** Remove obvious concluding sentences from some paragraphs. Relocate topic sentences. Allow some paragraphs to simply end.

### Pattern 3: Excessive Parallelism

**AI tendency:** Lists of three everywhere
- "X, Y, and Z"
- "First... Second... Third..."
- Repeated grammatical structures across consecutive sentences

**Human variation:**
- Lists of two, four, five
- Varying list structures
- Breaking parallel structure intentionally

**Fix:** Vary list lengths. Break parallel patterns occasionally. Use "and" lists vs. numbered lists inconsistently.

## Sentence-Level Patterns

### Pattern 4: The Participial Trailer

**AI formula:** `Subject + verb + object, [present participle] + additional detail`

**Examples:**
- "The team completed the project, demonstrating exceptional skill."
- "She opened the door, revealing a stunning view."
- "The data shows improvement, suggesting positive outcomes."

**Frequency:** AI uses this 2-5x more than humans.

**Fix:** 
- Delete trailing participial phrase
- Make it a separate sentence
- Move detail to sentence beginning
- Restructure entirely

**Alternatives:**
- "The team completed the project. Their skill was exceptional."
- "When she opened the door, a stunning view spread before her."
- "The data shows improvement—outcomes look positive."

### Pattern 5: The "From X to Y" Structure

**AI formula:** `From [noun phrase A] to [noun phrase B], [subject] [verb]`

**Examples:**
- "From bustling cities to serene landscapes, the country offers variety."
- "From beginners to experts, everyone can benefit."
- "From inception to execution, the process was seamless."

**Fix:**
- "The country's variety spans cities and landscapes."
- "Everyone benefits, regardless of experience level."
- "The process worked well throughout."

### Pattern 6: Semicolon-Connected Clauses

**AI tendency:** Excessive semicolon use to connect related ideas

**Examples:**
- "The results were clear; the hypothesis was confirmed."
- "The market shifted; companies adapted; profits rose."

**Human writing:** More varied connectors—periods, em-dashes, conjunctions, varying structures.

**Fix:**
- Use periods more often
- Use conjunctions (and, but, so)
- Use em-dashes for emphasis
- Vary subordination

### Pattern 7: The Hedged Opening

**AI formula:** Opening with qualifiers and hedges

**Examples:**
- "It's important to note that X is significant."
- "It's worth considering that Y has implications."
- "While it's true that Z exists, we should also consider..."

**Fix:** Delete the hedge, state directly:
- "X is significant because..."
- "Y affects..."
- "Z exists. However,..."

### Pattern 8: The Correlative Emphasis

**AI tendency:** Overuse of correlative conjunctions for emphasis

**Examples:**
- "Not only did X happen, but Y also occurred."
- "Both A and B are important."
- "Neither X nor Y works well."

**Fix:** Use in moderation. Often simpler alternatives work:
- "X happened, and so did Y."
- "A and B matter."
- "X doesn't work. Neither does Y."

## Phrase-Level Patterns

### Pattern 9: Adverb Placement

**AI tendency:** Adverbs consistently at sentence start or before verb

**Examples:**
- "Importantly, the results showed..."
- "Significantly, this changes..."
- "The team effectively managed..."

**Human variation:** Adverbs scattered more naturally, often eliminated entirely

**Fix:**
- Delete unnecessary adverbs
- Move adverbs to less predictable positions
- Replace with specific descriptions

### Pattern 10: The Nested Prepositional Phrase

**AI tendency:** Stacking prepositional phrases

**Example:** "In the context of the discussion of the implications of the data..."

**Fix:** Restructure to reduce prepositions:
- "Given what the data implies for our discussion..."
- "The data suggests..."

### Pattern 11: The Definitional Aside

**AI formula:** `X (which is/that is/or) definition`

**Examples:**
- "Synergy (the combined effect of working together) is important."
- "The MVP, or minimum viable product, should be ready."

**Human variation:** Definitions woven in more naturally or assumed as context

**Fix:**
- Assume reader knowledge when appropriate
- Integrate definitions into flow
- Use separate explanatory sentences

## Document-Level Patterns

### Pattern 12: The Mirror Conclusion

**AI tendency:** Conclusions that repeat introduction almost verbatim

**Tell:** Conclusion restates thesis, summarizes all points, often longer than needed

**Human variation:**
- Shorter conclusions
- Forward-looking endings
- New framing of central point
- Sometimes no formal conclusion

**Fix:**
- Cut conclusion length by 50%+
- End with implication rather than summary
- Avoid "In conclusion" / "In summary" / "Overall"
- Consider ending before the "conclusion"

### Pattern 13: Balanced Arguments

**AI tendency:** Every claim immediately balanced with counterpoint

**Example:** "While X is true, Y must also be considered. Although A exists, B complicates matters. Despite C, D remains relevant."

**Human variation:** Writers take positions, acknowledge complexity without constant hedging

**Fix:**
- Commit to positions where evidence supports
- Address counterarguments in dedicated sections, not every sentence
- Allow some claims to stand without immediate qualification

### Pattern 14: The Comprehensive Introduction

**AI tendency:** Introductions that preview everything to come

**Example:** "This essay will explore X, examine Y, analyze Z, and conclude with recommendations."

**Human variation:** More varied openings—hooks, questions, anecdotes, direct entry

**Fix:**
- Delete "this essay will" type phrases
- Open with specific detail or question
- Let structure emerge rather than announcing it

### Pattern 15: Uniform Transition Density

**AI tendency:** Transition at start of every paragraph

**Human variation:** Transitions used when needed, not mechanically

**Fix:**
- Remove 50% of paragraph-opening transitions
- Let paragraph flow naturally from previous
- Use transitions only when logical leap requires bridge

## Quick Diagnosis Checklist

Count in your text:

1. [ ] Paragraphs within 20 words of each other in length
2. [ ] Sentences starting with "Furthermore/Moreover/Additionally"
3. [ ] Trailing participial phrases (", [verb]-ing...")
4. [ ] "From X to Y" constructions
5. [ ] "It's important/worth noting that"
6. [ ] Semicolons per page (AI: >3; Human: 0-2)
7. [ ] Correlative conjunctions (not only/but also)
8. [ ] Paragraph-opening transitions

**Score:**
- 0-2: Low AI signal
- 3-5: Moderate AI signal—revise
- 6+: High AI signal—significant revision needed

## Burstiness Metrics

**Sentence length burstiness** (range between shortest and longest sentence):
- Human writing: 25+ word range typical
- AI writing: <15 word range (uniform length)

**Paragraph length burstiness** (standard deviation):
- Human writing: SD >30 words
- AI writing: SD <15 words (uniform paragraphs)

## Academic Writing Exemptions

**Patterns that ARE acceptable in formal academic writing:**

| Pattern | When Acceptable |
|---------|-----------------|
| Topic-sentence first | Standard for clarity |
| Explicit transitions between sections | Major section transitions |
| Parallel structure in lists | Deliberate for readability |
| "This paper/study" self-reference | Standard convention |
| Semicolons (1-2 per page) | Complex technical sentences |
| Balanced hedging | Evidence-based qualifications |

**Patterns to STILL fix in academic writing:**
- Trailing participial phrases (always fix)
- Empty hedging like "it's worth noting" (always delete)
- Corporate buzzwords (always replace)
- Uniform paragraph length (always vary)
